# Genosight

**Agent-Based Infrastructure for Verifiable Scientific Visualization**  

Figures you can trust, trace, and reuse.

## 🧠 What is Genosight?

Most scientific figures today are **just pixels**—no audit trail, no metadata, and no reproducibility.  
**Genosight** transforms visual outputs into **verifiable, self-contained records** backed by modular AI agents and cryptographic provenance.

> It’s not just a chart. It’s structured, reproducible evidence.

In internal testing, Genosight **reduced figure-prep time from 3–6 hours to under 3 minutes**, while preserving full traceability from raw dataset to final chart.

## 🚨 The Problem

Scientific figures are central to:
- Research transparency
- Peer review
- Regulatory filings

Yet today:
- **52% of biomedical findings are not reproducible** ([Amgen/Bayer studies])
- **No visual audit trails**
- **No link to data or methods**
- **No accountability**

> Researchers don’t just need visuals—they need **proof**.

## 🏗 Architecture: Agent-Driven by Design

Genosight is built as a **modular, agent-based system**, where each agent performs a deterministic task and logs all actions by design.

### Core Agents:
- `ChartGen Agent` – Generates context-aware figures
- `StatsCheck Agent` – Verifies statistical soundness
- `QA Agent` – Ensures formatting and accessibility
- `Provenance Agent` – Embeds metadata and hashes
- `Governance Agent` – Handles permissions, reviews, and approvals

Each figure is **anchored on-chain**, making it cryptographically verifiable and permanently attributable.

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verifiable by Default   | Embedded metadata + on-chain hashes = born traceable                        |
| Agent-Driven Workflow    | Modular AI agents handle generation, QA, and governance                     |
| High Efficiency          | Prep time drops from 3–6 hours → under 3 minutes                            |
| Audit-Ready & Compliant | 21 CFR Part 11-ready, with timestamped trails and tamper-proof logs         |
| Attribution Layer        | Figures are citable, reusable, and anchored to creator identity on-chain    |

**Powered by Decentralized Infrastructure**
To ensure tamper-proof provenance and permissionless traceability, Genosight leverages Web3-native infrastructure:
Powered by Decentralized Infrastructure

🔐 On-Chain Anchoring (BSC)
Each figure’s metadata—including dataset hashes, statistical methods, and authorship—is anchored on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring long-term immutability and public verifiability.

🎖 Attribution NFTs via WrapX
Every finalized figure is issued as a verifiable NFT, powered by WrapX, embedding creator identity, timestamp, and methodological lineage. These NFTs can be cited, reused, and even tokenized for credit and rewards in open science ecosystems.

📦 Decentralized Storage via Greenfield
Visual assets and their metadata bundles are optionally stored on Greenfield, BNB Chain’s decentralized storage network, enabling permissionless access and portable reproducibility across platforms.

## 🔬 Use Cases

- **🧬 Bioinformatics & Single-cell Analysis**  
  Generate UMAPs, volcano plots, and heatmaps in minutes—with embedded logic and traceable lineage.

- **🏥 Multi-Institutional Trials**  
  Sites don’t share raw data. Each runs the same agent stack, anchoring results to a shared ledger.

- **📑 Regulatory Filings (FDA, EMA)**  
  Meet compliance standards with audit-ready visuals and cryptographic proof of origin.

- **🌐 Open Science & Attribution**  
  Make your figures citable assets. Track reuse and receive on-chain credit.

## 🌍 Why Genosight?

Figures are the **visual language of science**—but today, they’re disconnected from the truth they claim to represent.

With Genosight:
- ✅ You don’t need to rerun the code
- ✅ You don’t need the raw data
- ✅ You just follow the **cryptographic trail**

> Genosight turns **figures into proofs**.
